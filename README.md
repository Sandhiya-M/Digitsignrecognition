With the advancement of today's technologies in artificial intelligence, humans tend to use hand gestures in their communication to convey their ideas. Gesture recognition is an active area of research in the human-computer interface (HCI). Gesture recognition is important for communication between deaf-mute people, HCI, robot control, home automation, and medical applications. In this project, a simple and efficient approach for digits recognition has been created to recognize hand gestures. Mediapipe introduced by Google had been used to get hand landmarks. The proposed system has been investigated with all the 9 digits and a train accuracy of 99% and a test accuracy of has been achieved. This work can be used to convert hand gestures into text.
The main objective of this project is 
•	To recognize hand gestures for digits using MediaPipe. 
•	To make the model suitable to any background and any signers.
•	The recognized digits can then be converted to text.
